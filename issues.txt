clicking "sign in" goes to URL "localhost:8080/?"
    but it should redirect to a room?
    my friend said something about not having the form submit on button press because
    i need to code the route to where it submits to

when i go to localhost:8080/chat/10s, terminal says
    "websocket: the client is not using the websocket protocol: 'upgrade' token not found in 'Connection' header"
